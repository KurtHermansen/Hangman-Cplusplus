# Overview

This hangman game was developed as a software engineering project to further my learning in the C++ programming language. The game demonstrates my understanding of C++ syntax and concepts, including functions, loops, conditionals, and working with strings and vectors.

The purpose of this software is to create an interactive hangman game where players can guess letters to uncover a secret word. It provides an engaging experience while showcasing my skills in C++ programming.
